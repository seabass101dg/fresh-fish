    What you need to know about me.
  </h2>

  <p>
    <strong>
      I have many leatherbound books.
    </strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    Education is a life-long endeavor. I have worked hard to earn my undergraduate degree, and I am continuing to prepare to enter a Master's program in the near future.

      <dd>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>
    <strong>
      These things also say I'm smart about other stuff.
    </strong>

      <dd>Cisco Certified Network Associate Routing and Switching, August, 2016</dd>

  </dl>

  <p>
    I should be earning the (ISC)<sup>2</sup> Certified Information Systems Security Professional very soon.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>
      What would you say... ya do here?
    </strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    I work for a government, non-profit organization specializing in security assistance and live-action role playing. Most people call it the US Army.
    <code>
      //TODO: Insert laugh-track here.
    </code>
  </p>

  <p>
    I initially commissioned in 2014 in the Infantry (MOS 11A) and worked as a rifle platoon leader and assistant operations officer. In 2017, I was selected to
    become a Network Systems Engineer (FA 26A), so now... I am become SysAdmin, the configurer of routers.
  </p>

  <p >
    No real-world experience in the field yet, but I'm always playing with my home servers, various other web clients, and virtual machines and networks.
    I'm pretty handy in Bash scripting, Python, Java, C#, and version control using Git. I've messed with C, C++, Ruby on Rails, SQL along with HTML/CSS.
    I wouldn't consider myself a Renaissance Man quite yet, more like a High Middle Ages Kid.
  </p>

  <h2>
    So now what?
  </h2>

  <p>
    I've got three more glorious years required of me in the US Army. Not sure where I'm going yet, but it's always a good idea to keep your options open and get
    your name out there.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Why do you have a website?
  </h2>

  <p>
    Honestly, I'm not sure. I understand how <code>"The Internet"</code> works in theory, but never put it to practice outside my sandbox.
    I had a little bit of cash laying around and decided to stake my claim in the Final Frontier.
