    <strong>
      What would you say... ya do here?
    </strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    I work for a government, non-profit organization specializing in
    security assistance and live-action role playing.
    Most people call it the US Army.
    <br>
    <code>
      //TODO: Insert laugh-track here.
    </code>
  </p>

  <p>
    I initially commissioned in 2014 in the Infantry (MOS 11A) and headed
    off to Fort Benning for Infantry Basic Officer Leader Course (IBOLC).
    Soon after, went to Fort Bliss, TX and worked as a rifle platoon leader
    and assistant operations officer for several years before being selected
    for transfer to Network Systems Engineer (FA 26A) in 2017.
    A little bit later in 2018, found myself at Fort Gordon, GA for the
    Signal Captains' Career Course (SCCC) and Network Systems Engineer Course
    (NSEC).
  </p>

  <p>
    I graduated NSEC in May 2019 then shipped off to Afghanistan to work
    as the director for the Regional Network Operations and Security Center
    of Afghanistan. I oversaw the operation and maintenance (O&M) of all of
    the LANs for US Forces in Afghanistan including user-facing Microsoft
    services. The assignment greatly expanded my depth of knowledge in systems
    and automation and solidified my experience in troubleshooting of switched
    environments. I also had the opportunity to manage several engineering
    and integration (E&I) projects.
  </p>

  <p>
    My work gives me plenty of opportunities to learn, but I'm always playing
    with my home servers, various other web clients, and virtual machines and
    networks. I've gotten pretty handy in Bash and PowerShell scripting,
    Python, Java, C#, and version control using Git. I've messed with C, C++,
    Ruby on Rails, SQL along with HTML/CSS. By now, I've mastered Cisco IOS,
    Cisco UCM and VoIP, and MS Active Directory. I wouldn't consider myself a
    Renaissance Man quite yet, but I'm having a good time regardless.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>
      Long Walks on the Beach et al.
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Working my way to the Thousand Pound Club, reading Wikipedia,
    hauling my KLR650 through the woods, and
    <a href="highpointer-map/index.html">climbing random things</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>
    So now what?
  </h2>

  <p>
    I've got two more glorious years required of me in the US Army.
    Not sure where I'm going yet, but it's always a good idea to keep
    your options open and get your name out there.

  <h2>
    Why do you have a website?
  </h2>

  <p>
    Honestly, I'm not sure. I understand how <code>"The Internet"</code>
    works in theory, but never put it to practice outside my sandbox.
    I had a little bit of cash laying around and decided to stake
    my claim in the Final Frontier.
